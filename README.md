### 2. Sign Up, Sign In Option and Forgot Password Along with Email OTP Verification:

- The application features a comprehensive user authentication system.
- New users can sign up by providing necessary details. Existing users can sign in using their credentials.
- In case users forget their password, they can reset it by receiving an OTP on their registered email, ensuring secure and verified access to their accounts.
  
### 3. Save Notes and View Notes of Projects:

- Users have the ability to create, save, and manage notes related to their projects.
- The notes can be categorized and tagged for easy retrieval. This feature helps users keep track of important information, ideas, and progress related to their projects.
- A user-friendly interface is provided to view and organize notes efficiently.
  
### 4. Document Summarization Using Map Reduce Technique:

- The application incorporates a document summarization feature with impactfull emojis using the MapReduce technique.
- This involves breaking down documents into smaller chunks, summarizing each chunk, and then aggregating the summaries to generate a final concise summary.
- This helps users quickly understand the main points and key information from lengthy documents.

### 5. Chat with Documents and URLs Using RAG Technique:

- The application includes a feature for users to chat with documents and URLs.
- This is implemented using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technique.
- Users can input queries, and the system retrieves relevant information from the documents and URLs, providing accurate and contextually relevant responses. This enhances the user's ability to extract specific information from large volumes of text.

   - word embedding - all-MiniLM-L6-v2 using langchain_community.embeddings library
   - vector database - facebook's vectorstore 'FAISS'
   - LLM - llama-3-8b using Groq

### 6. Used MongoDB for Storing Notes and Login Credentials:

- MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used for storing user notes and login credentials.
- MongoDB is known for its scalability, flexibility, and ease of use, making it ideal for managing large volumes of data.
- The database ensures secure storage of user information and provides fast access to notes and authentication data.

### 7. CI/CD Pipeline Using Streamlit Cloud for Automated Deployment:

- The application utilizes a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline facilitated by Streamlit Cloud. 
- This pipeline automates the process of testing, building, and deploying the application. 
- Any changes made to the codebase are automatically tested and deployed to the live environment, ensuring that the latest updates are always available to users without manual intervention.
